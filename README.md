<h1>Network Diagram Project</h1>



<h2>Description</h2>
For this project, I utilized a tool called "Draw.io" to build a network diagram based on certain requirements for a two-building office that will simulate the common practice of designing a network prior to getting into the actual routes and specific ways data will travel in that network.
<br />


<h2> Network Requirements </h2>

- Two offices: <b>San Francisco </b> and  <b> New York.</b>
- Each network requires a border router. 
- Each network needs a firewall blocking inbound traffic.
- San Francisco has four network subnets: R&D, Customer Support, IT and Data Center.
- New York has three network subnets: HR & Legal, Users and Business Apps.
- Both sites are connected via a VPN
